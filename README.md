# 🎓 Student Management & Grade Analytics System

A beginner-friendly Python project for managing student data and analyzing grades.  
This program allows users to add students, calculate statistics, save data to a file, and reload it later.

## 🚀 Features

- ➕ Add new students with name, age, and grade  
- 📊 Display student summaries and average grades  
- 🏆 Identify the best-performing student  
- ⚠️ List failing students below a custom grade threshold  
- 🧮 Group students by age  
- 💾 Save and load student data from a file  
- 🧭 Interactive menu-based interface in the terminal

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

This project demonstrates fundamental Python skills often used in **data analysis** and **backend scripting**:

- Lists & dictionaries  
- File handling (`open`, `read`, `write`)  
- Loops and conditionals  
- Functions and modular programming  
- Input validation with `try` / `except`  
- Sorting and data summarization
